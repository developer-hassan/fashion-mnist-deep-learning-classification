# fashion-mnist-deep-learning-classification

## Project Introduction

Fashion-MNIST data is one of the famous problems being solved by the deep neural networks. Here we use the dataset from keras.datasets api and solve the multi-class classification problem using TensorFlow.

## Dataset Requirement

There is no need to download the dataset externally as we can import the dataset from keras dataset's api.

## Libraries used

Following are the Python libraries used in project:

1. tensorflow
2. keras api
3. numpy
4. pandas
5. matplotlib
6. sklearn
